In the previous posting, we explored [What Jekyll is, its purpose, and its goals](../2024-03-22-about-jekyll/).

In this posting, we'll briefly look into *how to use* Jekyll.

## **Getting Started with Jekyll**
As mentioned in the previous post, Jekyll is a Ruby-based framework.

Therefore, [installing Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) involves two major steps:
1. Since it's a Ruby-based framework, [installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) is necessary. You can download a version *above 2.4.0* from the official site.

2. After installing Ruby, you need to install **Jekyll** and **Bundler Gem**.
```
gem install jekyll bundler
```
Typically, you input the above command in Windows CMD or Mac Terminal to install, but for more detailed information, it's advisable to refer to the links below:
- [Installation for Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/)
- [Installation for MacOS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)

## **Jekyll Website**
Once Jekyll installation is complete, you're now ready to create your website.

### 1) Creating a Github Repository
Create a Github Repository that will serve as the storage and path for your website.

To operate a *static website* by uploading web pages to the repository, you need a repository. Github has a system that allows you to run a repository as a static website, so we'll utilize this.

For making a Github page, refer to the site below:
> [Getting started with Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages)

### 2) Creating a Local Working Environment
After creating the repository, you need to create a working environment locally.

1. Copy the path from the github.io repository you created on Github.
<img src="/assets/images/jekyll/image9.jpg" alt="Alt text" class="post-markdown-img80">

2. Use a version control tool to clone it locally.
Enter the source path (URL) and the directory to clone.
(The image below is based on SourceTree)
<img src="/assets/images/jekyll/image10.jpg" alt="Alt text" class="post-markdown-img80">

You have now created an environment to work locally.

### 3) Generating Jekyll Files
Currently, the repository doesn't contain anything that can be called a website.
You will add various resources such as HTML, Script, CSS, Images, etc., to create a website.

These resources will be reflected even if uploaded directly, but we have sufficiently understood why we specifically use Jekyll in the previous post.
Therefore, we will create a file structure suggested by Jekyll.

For now, let's explain based on working in Windows CMD or Mac Terminal.

1. Move to the parent folder of the Repository in the console window.<br>
e.g., If the folder path is C:\test, then it's **cd C:\\**.
```
cd [Parent folder of the Repository]
```

2. Create a new Jekyll site.<br>
e.g., If the Repository name is test, then **jekyll new test**.
```
jekyll new [Repository name]
```
<img src="/assets/images/jekyll/image11.jpg" alt="Alt text" class="post-markdown-img100">

The following files will be created.
<img src="/assets/images/jekyll/image12.jpg" alt="Alt text" class="post-markdown-img100">

### 4) Local Build
An environment to use Jekyll has been created.

Although it's important to understand the role and structure of files, our goal for now is to generate html with Jekyll.

Let's build locally and test if it works correctly.

1. Move to the Repository
```
cd [Repository path]
```

2. Local Build
```
bundle build
```

3. Local Server Test
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If there weren't any major issues with the steps you've taken, the log should look like below.
![Alt text](/assets/images/jekyll/image13.jpg "Post-markdown-img100")
> Note: [If there are any problems](#local-server-issues)

Now, visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to check if the website displays correctly.
![Alt text](/assets/images/jekyll/image15.jpg "Post-markdown-img80")

If you see a screen like the one above, you have succeeded.

### 5) Commit and Push
Since it worked without any issues locally, let's reflect those changes in the Repository.
```
git commit -a -m "your message"
git push
```

### 6) Deploy
Once the changes have been reflected in the Repository, GitHub will start the Build and Deploy process.
- **Build**: The process of converting source code into executable software.
- **Deploy**: The process of installing and setting up the built software in a specific environment.

If the deploy was successful, it should look something like this.
![Alt text](/assets/images/jekyll/image16.jpg "Post-markdown-img100")

### 7) Accessing the Website
Unless you've specifically changed the URL settings, the Repository name and URL should be the same. Once the deploy has successfully completed, try accessing the site through the URL.

The path should start with https.
```
https://[My Github ID].github.io/
```

If successful, the screen should look the same as what you saw on your local server.
![Alt text](/assets/images/jekyll/image15.jpg "Post-markdown-img80")

You've created a website with Jekyll that others can access.

While it's currently showing the default screen, depending on how you utilize resources, you can create a great website. For more information, it is recommended to read and refer to the Jekyll Theme documentation.

## **Local Server Issues**

### Division Issue
- **Symptom**<br>
  You encounter the following message<br>
```
Deprecation Warning: Using / for division outside of calc() is deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0.
```
![Alt text](/assets/images/jekyll/image14.jpg "Post-markdown-img100")

- **Solution**
	- The division operator is no longer in use, so the warning message advises using the math or calc functions instead.
	- Navigate to the file where the issue occurred and replace the / operator with math or calc functions.

	- However, since it's just a warning, it's not mandatory to resolve it.
	- If this occurred while testing basic pages, you might not need to make any changes, especially if you plan to switch to a different template or screen layout later.
