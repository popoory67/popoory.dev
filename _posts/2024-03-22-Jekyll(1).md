Users starting with **Jekyll** likely aim to create their own blog or website.

So, what exactly is "Jekyll", and why is it used for website creation?

## **Jekyll**
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a framework that generates files for **Static websites**. 
It is developed in Ruby and automatically creates files according to the format I define.

Let's assume a situation to understand what *automatically generates* means.

### 1) Example
Consider there are web pages named A, B, and C.
![Alt text](/assets/images/jekyll/image7.jpg)

A, B, and C look the same but differ in color.

Explained in HTML terms, this is a situation that *the structure is the same, but data varies.*
> **HTML** is **a text file** describing where and how contents like images and texts are arranged.

Represented in text, it looks like this:
{% highlight html %}
<html> A Contents </html>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<html> B Contents </html>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<html> C Contents </html>
{% endhighlight %}

Analyzing this, it is found:
1. "<html> </html>" repeats.
2. "Contents" vary.

Thus, it's cumbersome to input "<html> </html>" every time I write HTML.

However, there is no need for that with "Jekyll".

### 2) Jekyll's Role
Jekyll takes on the task of generating HTML.

It manages files by separating the webpage's structure, **HTML**, and the content, **markdown**.

Then, through a process called **build**, it produces web pages.

It's convenient that Jekyll generates HTML, but why is this process necessary?

To explain simply, let's briefly talk about and compare to dynamic websites.

## **Dynamic Websites**
### 1) How Dynamic Websites Work
Well-known websites like Google and Amazon generate HTML on the server and present it to the viewers.

![Alt text](/assets/images/jekyll/image1.jpg)
This is called the dynamic website approach.

### 2) Example
For a typical scenario, consider:

A user searches for the word "Apple".
![Alt text](/assets/images/jekyll/image2.jpg)

Then, the server finds websites containing information about Apple and displays the search results to the user.
![Alt text](/assets/images/jekyll/image3.jpg)

In this process, the server:

1. Finds the Apple data.
2. Generates an HTML file containing the Apple data.
3. Displays the HTML on the user's screen.

This is how websites dynamically display content.

## **How to Operate a Website**
Though we've explained generating HTML through a server, is a server absolutely necessary to operate a website?

Not necessarily.

The essence of a website is *viewing the HTML.*
![Alt text](/assets/images/jekyll/image4.jpg)

Then, could we not upload the HTML file to a *repository* for others to download and view?
![Alt text](/assets/images/jekyll/image5.jpg)

Yes, that's possible.

This method of uploading and operating HTML in a repository is known as a **static website**.

## **Static Websites**
Static websites **pre-generate all** HTML making up the website and upload these files to a repository for others to view.

Therefore, unlike dynamic methods, there's no need to generate HTML in real-time, which is a significant advantage in terms of speed.

However, without a system to create the website like dynamic websites do, **all HTML must be prepared in advance.**

Thus, the volume of HTML to be stored is considerable, and there's a lot of repetitive content. From the perspective of writing HTML, it's highly inefficient to repeat the same tasks.

- Advantages<br>
1. No need to generate HTML in real-time.<br>
2. Faster web page display speed.<br>
- Disadvantages<br>
1. All web pages' HTML must be prepared in advance.<br>
2. A large amount of HTML must be stored.<br>
3. The same HTML content must be written repeatedly.<br>

If the HTML content is repetitive, creating a system to reuse the overlapping content seems like a solution.

Fortunately, frameworks that automatically generate content already exist, notably the **Jekyll** we intend to use.

Ultimately, we use Jekyll for a more straightforward and convenient composition of static websites.

## *In Conclusion...*
I've heard about using Jekyll for personal blogs. 
However, it wasn't immediately clear to me what Jekyll is and why it's used.

So, I started writing this article to help understand it easily. 
Since the goal is to comprehend the purpose of Jekyll, 
I've omitted as much technical content as possible.

<div class="message">
In reality, there are many components needed to build a webpage.
Beyond HTML, there are scripts, CSS, assets, and more. <br>
<br>
Dynamic websites also involve more complex logic and structure, 
but I've removed technical details to simplify the explanation. <br>
<br>
I hope this doesn't cause any confusion.
